## Kitchen Order Management System

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This is a small Node.JS project I worked on during early Summer 2023. You may find the following
information useful whilst navigating this project.
</p>
<p>
This Kitchen Management System simulates a typical fast food restaurant, complete with a customer-facing
kiosk ordering system, a customer-facing order tracker, and kitchen order monitor.
</p>
<p>
Please note this project remains a <b>work in progress</b>, and should be treated as such. The project
uses the Socket.IO library to communicate information between each of the components of the system,
therefore each tab will <b>not save data</b> if refreshed.
</p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>
I recommend using <b>Google Chrome</b> to run this project, as there are audible sounds within the project which cannot
be heard if you use other web browsers (such as Safari, which seems to block sound from being played).
</p>
<p>
Once this project has been downloaded, use a terminal to run the command: <code>node index.js</code>. This will start
the Node.JS server on port <i>6500</i> (if the default configuration is used). You may wish to edit the port used for
this project if the port number clashes with another service on your local
machine.
</p>
<p>
Access the main project by running <a href="https://localhost:6500">localhost:6500/</a> (replacing the port number if
appropriate).
</p>
<p>
Selecting any of the three menu items within the home page that appears will allow access the various areas of the
system. These will open in separate tabs.
