            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This is a small Node.JS project I worked on during early Summer 2023. You may find the following
                information useful whilst navigating this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Kitchen Management System simulates a typical fast food restaurant, complete with a customer-facing
                kiosk ordering system, a customer-facing order tracker, and kitchen order monitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note this project remains a <b>work in progress</b>, and should be treated as such. The project
                uses the Socket.IO library to communicate information between each of the components of the system,
                therefore each tab will <b>not save data</b> if refreshed.
            </p>
        </section>
        <br>
        <section class="howToUse">
            <h3>How to Use</h3>
            <p>
                This guide assumes you have successfully started the Node.JS server, and have accessed this webpage
                through your preferred web browser, using the address
                <a href="https://localhost:6500/">https://localhost:6500</a>. Please note, however, that
                <b>Google Chrome</b> is recommended.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select any of the three menu items above to access the various areas of the system. These will open in
                separate tabs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Kitchen Order Monitor</h4>
            <p>
                To be displayed in the kitchen, contains a live feed of orders that are processed by the
                <a href="custkiosk.html" target="_blank">kiosk</a>. Each order has its own timer, showing how long the
                order has been waiting to be processed by the kitchen, as well as a visual red/green indicator to
                visually indicate the time taken to process an order.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Space Bar on your keyboard acts as a <i>'serve'</i> button. The typical use case is to press this
                after an order's been made by the kitchen, and is ready to be served to the customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressing the 'V' key will alter the zoom level of the Kitchen Order Monitor, allowing for easier reading
                of the information on-screen, especially if the monitor were to be mounted further away from the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressing the 'C' key will open a small popup window used for order intake testing, and won't serve part
                of the final product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the bottom of the Monitor, there is a live clock, an indicator of both the average and maximum
                order processing times recorded since the Monitor was accessed, and an indicator of pending orders, which
                will indicate white whenever there are pending orders that cannot be immediately displayed on the screen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Customer Order Monitor</h4>
            <p>
                This provides a 'live' feed to customers relating to the progress of their order. Currently only has
                two main sections - 'Preparing' and 'Please Collect', along with an order number.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has no interactive parts - the order number will move automatically as soon as the serve button is
                hit on the Kitchen Order Monitor. Once an order's been <i>served</i>, the customer order monitor will
                clear the order number after 60 seconds.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Customer Kiosk</h4>
            <p>
                An interactive ordering system for customers to place their orders, styled similarly to that of typical
                high street fast food chains. Allows products to be selected, quantities updated, and orders to be
                processed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is currently a <b>work in progress</b>, with more features being introduced in due course, such
                as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Order Customisations</li>
                <li>Food Categories (these buttons currently do not work)</li>
            </ul>
